# **Weaver**

The idea is to have a single process instance running of weaver which receives commands it can execute either by making calls to the server or otherwise.

### **Design Considerations:**

\- The singleton design ensures that only one instance of the weaver process is running at any given time, preventing multiple instances from conflicting with each other.

\- The weaver process initializes and performs any necessary setup during the first run. After that, it detaches from the main process, allowing the main process to continue without waiting for the weaver to complete its tasks.

\- Subsequent commands are sent to the existing weaver process, which is already running in the background. This allows for efficient command processing without the overhead of starting a new process each time.

**Process Behavior:**

While the weaver process is running and waiting for commands, it typically performs the following:

\- \*\*Command Handling:\*\*  
 - The process is in a loop, waiting for commands. When a command is received, it processes the command and performs the necessary actions. This could include merging configurations, updating internal state, or triggering specific functionalities.

\- \*\*Listening Mechanism:\*\*  
 - The weaver process likely has some form of listener (e.g., listening on a socket, using channels, or other inter-process communication mechanisms) to receive and process commands.

\### Exiting the Process:

Exiting the weaver process can be handled gracefully. In the provided example code, the weaver process listens for termination signals (SIGINT and SIGTERM). When such a signal is received, the process executes cleanup tasks and exits. The cleanup tasks could include closing connections, saving state, or any other necessary cleanup operations.

\`\`\`go  
func (wp \*weaverProcess) exitSignal() \<-chan os.Signal {  
   sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)  
   signal.Notify(sigChan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)  
   return sigChan  
}

// ...

func (wp \*weaverProcess) run() {  
   // ...  
   for {  
       select {  
       case \<-wp.exitSignal():  
           // Cleanup tasks before exiting  
           fmt.Println("Weaver process terminated.")  
           return  
       // Handle other commands  
       }  
   }  
}  
\`\`\`

This allows for a clean exit when the termination signal is received, ensuring that the weaver process releases resources and shuts down gracefully.
