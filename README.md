## Introduction

Task Automation and Scheduling is a critical component of modern Platform Engineering. This project aims to offer a robust solution for defining, scheduling, and executing various tasks, enabling users to automate routine activities, minimize errors, and enhance productivity. From managing simple recurring tasks to orchestrating complex workflows, this platform provides the tools necessary to achieve these goals effectively.

## Features

**Task Definition and Management:** Users can easily define tasks through an intuitive interface or a configuration file. Each task includes execution commands, input parameters, and dependency specifications. The platform allows users to create, update, delete, and monitor their scheduled jobs.

**Scheduling Engine:** The project incorporates a powerful scheduling engine that supports diverse scheduling types, such as fixed intervals, cron-like expressions, and date-based schedules. Tasks can also be prioritized, ensuring critical tasks receive higher precedence for execution.

**Distributed Execution:** To ensure scalability and handle high workloads, the platform implements a distributed execution system. This involves a cluster of worker nodes that execute tasks concurrently, distributing the load efficiently.

**Task Monitoring and Logging:** Users can monitor task status, including successful completions, failures, or pending execution. Comprehensive logging captures task outputs and errors, facilitating later analysis.

**Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:** The platform gracefully manages task failures by notifying users and automatically retrying tasks based on predefined policies. Users can customize the number of retries and intervals between retries.

**Security and Access Control:** Robust user authentication and access control mechanisms safeguard task definition, scheduling, and management functions. Users enjoy granular control over permissions, ensuring secure task management.

**Alerting and Notifications:** An integrated alerting system informs users of task failures or errors, allowing them to choose their preferred notification channels, such as email, Slack, or SMS.

**Dashboard and Reporting:** The user-friendly dashboard provides an overview of scheduled tasks, execution history, and resource utilization. Task execution metrics and reports facilitate performance analysis.

**Scalability and Performance:** The project prioritizes performance optimization and scalability, catering to growing task volumes and user demands. Horizontal scaling, load balancing, and caching strategies contribute to improved performance.

**Integration with External Systems:** Integration with version control systems (e.g., Git) automates task triggering upon specific branch changes. Additionally, collaboration with cloud providers and container orchestrators maximizes resource utilization.

## Architecture

The architecture of this platform revolves around distributed job scheduling. It leverages a combination of single-node and cluster setups to efficiently manage tasks. This architecture accommodates various platforms and environments, making it adaptable to Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.

## Plugin System

A plugin system enhances the project's extensibility and versatility. It introduces a well-defined plugin interface, a registry for plugin management, dynamic loading capabilities, and user-configurable plugins. This system enables users to define custom task types, integrate with external systems, enhance scheduling options, and expand notification channels.

## Integration with External Systems

The project integrates seamlessly with external systems, such as Kubernetes (K8s), Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, and AWS Batch. These integrations provide users with additional options for managing tasks, enhancing scalability, and leveraging industry-standard tools.

## Research

The development of this project involved research and inspiration from various existing systems:

- Kubernetes (K8s): Container orchestration platform that ensures efficient task distribution and management.
- Apache Kafka: Distributed event streaming platform, valuable for handling task events and triggers.
- Apache Airflow: Workflow automation and scheduling platform, offering insights into task orchestration.
- AWS Batch: Managed batch computing service, providing insights into task execution and resource management.
